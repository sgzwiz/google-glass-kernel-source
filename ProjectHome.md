Google Glass kernel GPL source.

Currently there is a tarball of the kernel source in downloads.

notle\_defconfig should work as the kernel configuration target

Update:
The  kernel source for the xrr02 build is now available in AOSP on the "glass-omap-xrr02" branch of the kernel/omap project.
As this is the recommended way of acquiring the kernel sources, this project will be redirected , and the download deleted, in a day or two
